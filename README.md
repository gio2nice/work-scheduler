# Work-Scheduler

## Description

The task for this project was to build an online planner for the user project tracking using Bootstrap, jQuery and moment. When you load the application, you are presented with the current date and time using moment. The user can store their text to local storage using the save button to the right. The time block will recognize if the time is in past, present, or future and is color coded. So the past is #d3d3d3 (grey-ish), the present is #ff6961(red ish color) and the future #77dd77(green). :smile:
